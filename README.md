## About the database (WCGDB)
An open access the worldwide Campylobacter genome database (WCGDB) were constructed by integrating 86,365 publicly available genomes from 53 countries, covering 1954â€“2023. In total, 66,771 high-quality genomes including  2,771 sequence types (STs) were obtained. Using the WCGDB, we present a spatiotemporal picture of antimicrobial resistance genes, virulome, and mobilome in the Campylobacter worldwide. We further observed that economic, climatic, and social factors can drive the rise of AMR. We hope that the WCGDB and correlation analysis strengthen the case for data collection and sharing for the public good, especially WGS, which provides data on the early identification of emerging resistance genes and outbreaks. The Campylobacter genome sequences, statistical analysis results and a list of accession number for their genomes are available on this web page.
Overall, this study represents the largest Campylobacter genome database worldwide (WCGDB) and presents the most comprehensive genomic snapshot of Campylobacter to date, with almost 66,771 high-quality genomes originating from 53 countries between 1954 and 2023. This database will assist future genomic surveillance studies and will help inform interventions for foodborne diseases, AMR, food safety, and public health.
